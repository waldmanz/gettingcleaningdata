gettingcleaningdata
===================

This is a repository for Zev Waldman's course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, part of the Coursera / Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization, May 2014

The repository was updated after project grading to correct an error with the analysis script.

The repository contains the following files:

1.      README.md: This file.
2.      CodeBook.md: A markdown file describing the raw data, the tidy dataset, and the steps used to create the tidy dataset.
3.      run_analysis_v2.R: R script used to generate tidy data from the raw data.  It requires the raw data in the R working directory.
4.      final_tidy_dataset.txt: A space-delimited text file with the tidy data produced by the script.

The raw dataset is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.  The reference is provided below:
