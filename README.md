This repository contains the following files in addition to this README:

- CodeBook.md   
- run_analysis.R 
- tidy_dataset.txt

run_analysis.R is an R script used to generate tidy data from the raw data.  It requires the raw data in the R working directory.

CodeBook.md is a markdown file describing the raw data, the tidy data, and the steps used to create the tidy data.

tidy_dataset.txt is a space-delimited text file with headers containing the tidy data.

The raw dataset is the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0.  The full citation of the dataset is as follows:
